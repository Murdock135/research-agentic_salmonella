Here's a step-by-step analytical plan to investigate the correlation between social vulnerability and salmonella rates in Missouri:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_description": "Load relevant datasets from /home/zayan/Documents/code/personal_repos/research-agentic_salmonella/selected_data",
      "datasets": ["Missouri_Social_Vulnerability_Index", "Missouri_Salmonella_Rates"],
      "rationale": "These datasets are necessary to understand the relationship between social vulnerability and salmonella rates in Missouri.",
      "task_type": ["data_retrieval"]
    },
    {
      "step_description": "Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization",
      "datasets": ["Missouri_Social_Vulnerability_Index", "Missouri_Salmonella_Rates"],
      "rationale": "This step is necessary to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.",
      "task_type": ["data_cleaning"]
    },
    {
      "step_description": "Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of social vulnerability and salmonella rates",
      "datasets": ["Missouri_Social_Vulnerability_Index", "Missouri_Salmonella_Rates"],
      "rationale": "This step is necessary to identify patterns and relationships in the data.",
      "task_type": ["data_exploration"]
    },
    {
      "step_description": "Calculate the correlation coefficient between social vulnerability and salmonella rates using a suitable statistical method (e.g., Pearson's r)",
      "datasets": ["Missouri_Social_Vulnerability_Index", "Missouri_Salmonella_Rates"],
      "rationale": "This step is necessary to quantify the relationship between social vulnerability and salmonella rates.",
      "task_type": ["statistical_analysis"]
    },
    {
      "step_description": "Visualize the correlation using a suitable plot (e.g., scatterplot, bar chart)",
      "datasets": ["Missouri_Social_Vulnerability_Index", "Missouri_Salmonella_Rates"],
      "rationale": "This step is necessary to facilitate interpretation of the results.",
      "task_type": ["visualization"]
    },
    {
      "step_description": "Interpret the results and draw conclusions about the relationship between social vulnerability and salmonella rates in Missouri",
      "datasets": ["Missouri_Social_Vulnerability_Index", "Missouri_Salmonella_Rates"],
      "rationale": "This step is necessary to provide actionable insights for public health policy.",
      "task_type": ["interpretation"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that this plan assumes the existence of two datasets: `Missouri_Social_Vulnerability_Index` and `Missouri_Salmonella_Rates`. The specific steps and tasks may vary depending on the actual structure and content of these datasets.
